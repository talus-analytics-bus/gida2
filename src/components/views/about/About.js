      <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p>
        Measles Tracker was developed by Talus Analytics to provide up-to-date
        information on global measles outbreaks and vaccination coverage,
        providing a global picture to support public health decision making and
        efforts to control and eliminate measles. The dashboard provides access
        to analysis and data visualizations communicating the status of ongoing
        outbreaks relative to who is vaccinated, where, and whether these
        outbreaks are improving or worsening. These trends in vaccination and
        measles caseload are provided at the country level with the ability to
        view global comparisons and draw new insights by bringing together the
        best available data tracking measles cases and vaccination coverage,
        currently and over time. Where available, key information about country
        capacity to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to public health
        threats is also included in the form of assessment results from the
        Joint External Evaluation process performed under the International
        Health Regulations.

      <h1>Data and methods documentation</h1>
      <p>
        The Measles Tracker provides up-to-date information on global measles
        outbreaks and vaccination coverage to support public health decision
        making. The dashboard provides access to data visualizations
        communicating who is vaccinated, where, relative to the status of
        ongoing outbreaks. Below, we describe the sources of data integrated
        within the dashboard and the analytical methods used to analyze and
        communicate those data.
      </p>
      <h2>Data sources</h2>
      <p>
        The Measles Tracker relies on a set of core data elements that,
        together, provide an overview of vaccination efforts. Vaccination
        coverage data define the percent of the population who have been
        vaccinated for measles. Typically, measles vaccination occurs in a two
        dose sequence of measles-containing vaccine (MCV), so vaccination
        coverage can be reported as the percent of the population who have
        received at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1), or the
        percent of the population who have received two doses of
        measles-containing vaccine (MCV2).
        <a class={styles.footnote} href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">
          [1]
        </a>{" "}
        This two-dose course of measles is believed to provide lifetime
        immunity, and booster doses are typically not needed.
        <a class={styles.footnote} href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">
          [2]
        </a>{" "}
        As a result, vaccination coverage data are typically reported on an
        annual basis, as the majority of vaccination efforts are focused largely
        on infants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caseload data define the total number of new measles cases in a given
        geography at a given point in time. These data are reported monthly by
        the World Health Organization (WHO), and include laboratory confirmed,
        epidemiologically linked, and/or clinical cases reported to WHO. Based
        on these available caseload data, it is possible to calculate the
        monthly incidence rate, or the number of persons newly diagnosed with
        measles, per 1,000,000 total population, per month.
        <a class={styles.footnote} href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">
          [3]
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For context on existing public health and economic capacity, and to
        enable comparisons between countries, vaccination coverage and caseload
        data must also be compared alongside other relevant information on a
        country&rsquo;s current status, including, for example, scores from
        Joint External Evaluations

      <h2>Data analysis, processing, and integration</h2>
      <h3>Calculating monthly incidence rates</h3>
      <p>
        Monthly incidence rates for the total population are estimated as the
        number of new measles cases in the most recent month for which data are
        available divided by the total population size. These data are reported
        as the number of cases per 1,000,000 total population per month, and are
        calculated using measles caseload data from WHO and population
        demographic data from the UN World Population Prospects.
      </p>
      <h3>Quantifying increase and decrease in monthly caseload</h3>
      <p>
        Available caseload data report the number of cases per country, per
        month. An outbreak is indicated as &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; if the
        number of cases in the most recent month for which data are available is
        greater than the number of cases in the prior month. The percent change
        in cases from month to month is calculated as the difference in the
        total number of cases between the current month and the prior month,
        divided by the total number of cases in the prior month.
      </p>
      <h3>Addressing missing (or not-yet reported) caseload data</h3>
      <p>
        Countries report caseload data to the World Health Organization every
        1-2 months, and not always at the same frequency. In data available from
        the World Health Organization, for the most recent month for which data
        are available, some countries have reported caseload data, and some have
        not. However, the WHO dataset does not distinguish between &ldquo;data
        not yet reported&rdquo; and &ldquo;0 cases reported&rdquo;. As a result,
        for the most recent month for which data are available, all values of
        zero are treated as &ldquo;data not yet reported&rdquo; and therefore a
        missing value. These values will be iteratively updated as new data
        become available. In the site, the most recently available data will be
        shown, so for countries with these missing values indicated for the most
        recent month, caseload data (with appropriate timestamp labels) from the
        prior month will be shown by default until additional data become
        available.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of October 2019, the WHO Measles Surveillance Dataset contains no
        caseload data for Algeria or Ecuador for the year 2019. As a result,
        caseload data cannot be shown for these countries.
      </p>
      <h3>Crosswalking Joint External Evaluations 1.0 and 2.0</h3>
      <p>
        Joint External Evaluations (JEEs) assess a country&rsquo;s capacity to
        prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats. Countries
        are assessed across 19 technical areas, each of which is scored based on
        one or more specific indicators that have attributes reflecting various
        levels of capacity. Scores range from one to five, where one indicates{" "}
        <em>no capacity</em> and five indicates <em>sustainable capacity</em>.
        The Measles Tracker summarizes country-level capacity based on the
        average of indicator-level scores for the following core capacities
        related to measles prevention, detection, and response:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Immunization</li>
        <li>Real Time Surveillance</li>
        <li>Medical Countermeasures and Personnel Deployment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Two versions of the JEE have been released, a first edition (JEE 1.0)
        released in February 2016 and a second, revised edition (JEE 2.0), with
        revised questions and scoring rules, released in January 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of October 2019, a total of 82 countries have completed JEE 1.0 and
        10 countries have completed JEE 2.0.
        <a class={styles.footnote} href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">
          [6]
        </a>{" "}
        To align the scores between the two assessments and enable an
        &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; comparison of scores, scores from JEE 1.0
        must be crosswalked to align with scores from JEE 2.0 based on a series
        of data alignment rules documented in Appendix 2 of JEE 2.0.
        <a class={styles.footnote} href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">

      <p>
        In the Measles Tracker, scores from JEE 2.0 are reported directly, while
        scores from JEE 1.0 are first crosswalked to align with JEE 2.0 scores
        based on the scoring rules documented below, derived from Appendix 2 of
        JEE 2.0.

            The World Health Organization recommends administering MCV1 between
            9 and 12 months of age, and MCV2 a minimum of 4 weeks after the
            first dose; however, country-specific vaccination strategies vary
            (e.g., the US recommends vaccinating children with MCV1 between
            12-15 months of age, and MCV2 between 4-6 years old).

            vaccine as children, people who received the killed measles vaccine

            Countries report data every 1-2 months, and not always at the same
            frequency. In data available from the World Health Organization, for
            the most recent month for which data are available, some countries
            have reported caseload data, and some have not. However, the WHO
            dataset does not distinguish between &ldquo;data not yet
            reported&rdquo; and &ldquo;0 cases reported&rdquo;. As a result, for
            the most recent month for which data are available, all values of
            zero are treated as &ldquo;data not yet reported&rdquo; and
            therefore a missing value. These values will be iteratively updated
            as new data become available. In the site, the most recently
            available data will be shown, so for countries with these missing
            values indicated for the most recent month, caseload data (with
            appropriate timestamp labels) from the prior month will be shown by
            default until additional data become available.
